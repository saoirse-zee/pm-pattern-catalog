A little clickable thing based on [SF's LDS button](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/buttons).
Lightning sets the base styles, and then we overwrite whatever we need.


```hint
Use it when you need to click on a thing.
```

```html
span: 1
---
<div class="slds-button_brand patman-button_brand" onclick="placeholder()">
  Boo
</div>
```
