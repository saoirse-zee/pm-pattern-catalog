# Catalog Demo

Quick start:
```
npm install
npm run catalog-start
```
This runs the catalog in dev mode. Visit http://localhost:4000/#/.

To build for deployment:
```
npm run catalog-build
```
This builds the catalog and puts it in the `docs` folder. This makes it easy to publish using [GitHub pages](https://saoirse-zee.github.io/pm-pattern-catalog/).
